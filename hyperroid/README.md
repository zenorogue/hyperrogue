This directory contains the sources of the Android port of HyperRogue.

You should copy the sound and music files from HyperRogue's main directory to
the directories here; also `language-data.cpp` file generated during HyperRogue's build
process is required. This is done by the script `copy.sh`.

The 'low quality' versions of music files are already in their location (copying them
is uncommented in copy.sh).

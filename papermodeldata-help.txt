How to create your own net for a paper model:

1) Edit the parameters above. These are:

  a) How many cells to put in the model. Currently, the cells are given in order
    of increasing distance from the player, so you should probably enter one of
    the numbers from the list below (if the player is placed on a heptagon):
    
    1 8 22 50 99 183 330 582
    
    For example, there are 50 cells in radius 3.

  b) (SX,SY) Size of the window used to edit the net. For example 1280x905
  
  c) (PX,PY) How many pages you are going to print. For best results,
    (SX/PX, SY/PY) should correspond to the size of the paper you are using.
  
  d) Scale factor. Bigger scale creates files of a larger resolution,
     but uses more memory and disk space. 3 is default.
  
  e) Model size. Bigger number creates files of a better quality,
     but uses more memory and disk space. 2000 is default.
  
  f) Edge length of each shape, in pixels. You can change this later while editing.
  
  g) Keep this as 0 to mark that the net is not yet created.
  
2) Make a backup of papermodeldata.txt, and copy this file to papermodeldata.txt.

3) Run HyperRogue, and choose the 'create paper models' option.

4) A net editor is shown. Initially, all the cells are glued together, and they don't
  fit in the Euclidean plane. You have to distribute them over the screen, so that
  they are no longer covering each other. Hover over a glued edge, press 'g' to
  unglue them, and then drag one of the parts away with the mouse.
  
  You can also use 'g' to glue an edge back, PgUp/Dn to rotate a fragment of the net,
  z/x to resize the model. 

5) After you exit the editor, papermodeldata2.txt will contain the data of the net 
  you have created. If you want to reuse it, just copy this to papermodeldata.txt.
